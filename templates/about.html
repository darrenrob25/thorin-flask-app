    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oaakenshield</h3>
            <p>Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
                Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in
                exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA
                2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his
                shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                which remained with him even in death.</p>

            <p>Fíli and Kíli were Dwarvern brothers and were also the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin
                Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin.
            
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
                come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
                the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five
                Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
                company of Thorin..</p>

                companions.
